Here’s a clear breakdown of **QuickTime recording shortcuts** on macOS:

---

### 🎥 Screen Recording (using macOS built-in tools)

QuickTime itself doesn’t have dedicated shortcuts, but Apple added **Shift + Command + 5** to bring up the **Screen Capture/Recording toolbar**:

* **Shift + Command + 5** → Open recording controls
  (choose “Record Entire Screen” or “Record Selected Portion”)
* **Command + Control + Esc** → Stop recording immediately

👉 These are the fastest built-in shortcuts. Behind the scenes, they use QuickTime’s recorder.

### 🎤 Audio/Video Recording (inside QuickTime Player)

No direct global hotkeys exist, but within QuickTime Player:

* **Option + Command + N** → New Screen Recording
* **Control + Option + Command + N** → New Audio Recording
* **Command + Option + N** (older versions) → New Movie Recording

⚠️ Note: **Pause is not available** in QuickTime. You can only Start or Stop. To mimic “pause,” record multiple clips and merge them in QuickTime (`Edit → Add Clip to End`).

### ✅ If you want real Pause/Resume hotkeys

You’ll need a third-party app like:

* **OBS Studio** (free, customizable hotkeys)
* **ScreenFlow / Camtasia** (paid, professional, with pause/resume support)

---

Do you want me to write you an **AppleScript + Automator/Shortcuts workflow** so you can trigger QuickTime recording with a single keystroke (like `F9` to start, `F10` to stop)? That’s possible.
