Since youâ€™re on **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish)**, the next **LTS** release is **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Noble Numbat)**.
Upgrading between LTS versions is officially supported and relatively straightforward, but itâ€™s important to follow the right steps.

Hereâ€™s the recommended process:

---

### **1. Update your current system**

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt dist-upgrade -y
sudo apt autoremove --purge -y
```

> This ensures you have all the latest patches for 22.04 before upgrading.

---

### **2. Check and install the upgrade tool**

```bash
sudo apt install update-manager-core
```

Make sure `/etc/update-manager/release-upgrades` has:

```
Prompt=lts
```

---

### **3. Start the upgrade**

Since you want **latest LTS**, run:

```bash
sudo do-release-upgrade
```

If it says "No new release found" (because 24.04 upgrades from 22.04 may not be offered immediately for servers), you can force it:

```bash
sudo do-release-upgrade -d
```

> The `-d` flag forces an upgrade to the latest development release, but after April 2024, 24.04 is considered stable, so it just points to Noble Numbat.

---

### **4. Follow the prompts**

* The process will download packages, then ask about replacing config files â€” usually safe to accept the new versions unless you have custom changes.
* Server upgrades will temporarily disable third-party PPAs; you can re-enable them later.

---

### **5. Reboot**

```bash
sudo reboot
```

---

### **6. Verify version**

```bash
lsb_release -a
```

You should see:

```
Distributor ID: Ubuntu
Description:    Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
Release:        24.04
Codename:       noble
```

---

ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** Always back up `/etc/` configs and important data before upgrading in case something breaks.

If you like, I can also give you **a one-shot upgrade script** that safely does all these steps in sequence.
Would you like me to prepare that?
